# coding-project-template

## This is the final project of IBM React Course.

We have been given a starter code to start this project and have been asked to accomplish task adding and modifying code.
Some of the task were making sure the clicking adding card button adds to correct amount and gets disabled, deleting the added item etc.

I have passed this final projects with 100% grade.
